# SeleniumTestsFinalProject
Final Project of Web Development course 

This is a test repo, with test about WhereToEat ( https://github.com/DAWZayas/wheretoeat )

This project is realized by Guillermo Morillo but the owner is IES Mar√≠a de Zayas y Sotomayor.

The function of this project is to show what is Selenium, what is the philosophy behind it,
and show how to create some simple test about a web.

I do this with IntelliJ Idea, Java, Selenium, Junit, and with Page - Object patron.
